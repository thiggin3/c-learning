# c-learning
This is a repository for my C programming learning practice projects
Day 1: 
    -Learning how to use Github
    -Learning how to use GitHub using Git
    -Created A simple "hello.c" file that prints "Hello, GitHub!" and placed them in the "First Program" folder
    -Learned about directives
        These are things like #include. Directives are things that the precompiler needs to know before compling the program. Such as #include <stdio.h> includes standard input/output for various things such as printf.
    -Learned about statements
        Basically commands.
        Each command must end with a ; to mark the end of that command for it to move onto the next command.
    -Learned about printf
        Printf must include the new line character \n or elses the program will continue to output on the same line.
        A single printf statement can carry multiple \n to print on multiple lines.
    -Learned about comments
        Written like /* This is a comment */
        They can also span multiple line such as:
        /*This is
        also a 
        comment*/
